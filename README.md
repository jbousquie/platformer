[Macroquad Site](https://macroquad.rs/)

## How to Play

-   **Move Left/Right**: Use the Left and Right arrow keys.
-   **Jump**: Press the Up arrow key.
-   **Grab/Throw Items**: Press the `SPACE` key to grab a nearby item. Press `SPACE` again to throw it.
-   **Grab/Release Blocks**: Press the `SPACE` key to grab a nearby block, or to release one you are holding. Blocks cannot be thrown.

## GUI

A simple GUI is displayed at the top of the screen, showing:
- **Keys**: The number of keys collected out of the total.
- **Score**: The player's score (placeholder).
- **Lives**: The number of remaining lives (placeholder).


## Game Entities

### Baddies

Baddies are simple enemies that roam the level. They walk back and forth, randomly jump, and can fall off platforms. Upon colliding with a block, they have a small chance to pick it up and carry it for a while. They do not interact with the player.

### Keys

Keys are collectible items. The goal of the game is to collect all of them.
